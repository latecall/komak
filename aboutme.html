        <p>Arman here every one, born in 1978, I used to play tennis since 8 in Iran, being coached early mornings before my
            my school, I learned the basic techniques in 10 hours with my coach and learned every thing I 
            know now by watching and competing, which took me so long comparing to the players who get coaches
            by their side. <br>
            After 30 years of playing I injured my right hand wrist severly that I had no choice but to go as a lefty!
            now I play both hands as the circumstances demand.<br>        
            <br> After arriving in UK I started taking part in Park Tournaments conducted by LTA 
            and I had satisfactory results. mentioning that I finished with an injury which stoped me from 
            taking part in more.
            I still play but with my left hand, just as to keep myself moving. I play around Plat Fields Park 
            almost everyday. Ready to coach you if you want to start the right way from the beginning, minding 
            you that if one starts tennis on its own, one will have the techniques executed wrongly and will 
            suffer from improving to the high levels, and it takes much time and energy to correct the wrong 
            techniques, so why not starting the right way?!
