        <h2>tip to start each tennis season</h2>
        <br>
        <p>When the Manchester wheather is good, one can see many people heading to parks with their tennis bags, 
            this is usually from April that they open their tennis bags and start hitting with their last year's 
            old flat tennis balls, which is not a bad start! But the problem is when you give them new balls, 
        then they will miss most of the shots, for the simple fact that new balls are way faster.<br>This is the 
        easiest to improve your tennis level every year.<br> And this why the balls change after first 7 games 
    and 9 games thereafter in an official match, this is because players have been warming up with the balls they srated the match 
with, therefore they will change to new balls after 9 games thereafter.</p>
